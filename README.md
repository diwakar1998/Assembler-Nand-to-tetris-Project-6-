# Assembler-Nand-to-tetris-Project-6-
This is done as part of a course called Nand to tetris where we built a working computer from scratch. The objective of the course is to make a computer i.e hardware with working software to interact with the hardware we built!

To run the assembler type this in terminal

python assembler.py ##your file name without the extension##

Note: make sure the assembly file is in main folder where the .py files are in.
